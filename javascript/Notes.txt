---------------
* idea: do at least one checkin per pomodoro
* focus to replace temp with query.

* took some time to understand code after 2 months
* Peter changed code alone, maybe should not have done so, only add TODOs
* Martin likes mocha Watcher, and it runs inside IDEA termninal - great!
* Martin likes instant feedback of mocha watcher runner
* Peter is shocked by JS type mangling/chaos ;-)
* maybe should have zero warnings firsr before doing real work (learning)
* existing private methods suite us well to implement next rule
* we like small functions
* worked out well, pair switching worked well
* Martin says the TeamViewer host should be driver most of the time (interesting point for remote work)
