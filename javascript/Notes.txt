* only two months this time
* short session only 1h work time
* Teamviewer does not work for Martin any more, need another tool
  use only screen sharing today, switch presenter between sessions
* Do not want to patch general objects th

* Plan for next time: Goal is to
  TODO plan for next session:

--------------
* Cool to use dynamic arguments and dynamic construction.
* We see more of magic JS today, all the basic logic was finished.
* Inly two months passed, no problem to start again.
* Good to have a plan for next time at end of retrospective.
* Cool to do some refactoring step by step. Nice to see green.
* Baby steps worked out fine.
* Mocha error messages are difficult to read, esp. in small terminal.
* REPL would have been nice for prototyping JS specific things like arguments.

* Plan for next time: Goal is to
  return Dices instead of [] so we can call ..sum and ..max instead of sum(..)
* Need to cleanup dynamic Dices creation, use diceWith in all places, continue replacement
* Same for max().
* try next time the node REPL.

--------------
* again 3 months passed - this is an exercise to practice "get into code again" ;-)
* we got into it fast, we are almost done
* zero warnings first
* good, we committed frequently
* we did not make any breaks (forgot the timer)
* we learned that files need to be required if we want to test them, it is not assert's fault
* Peter learned that IDEA uses fancy color codes in navigator

* will we be able to read it in two months?
* plan for next time is to change design, create object for Dices, which is not Yatzi specific

--------------
* idea: at least one check-in per Pomodoro
* focus to replace temp with query.

* took some time to understand code after 2 months
* Peter changed code alone, maybe should not have done so, only add TODOs
* Martin likes mocha Watcher, and it runs inside IDEA terminal - great!
* Martin likes instant feedback of mocha watcher runner
* Peter is shocked by JS type mangling/chaos ;-)
* maybe should have zero warnings first before doing real work (learning)
* existing private methods suite us well to implement next rule
* we like small functions
* worked out well, pair switching worked well
* Martin says the TeamViewer host should be driver most of the time (interesting point for remote work)

--------------
* during Coding Dojo Vienna
* identify code smells, make instance invocation consistent
* rewrite methods functional style

Constraints
-----------
* extract low level classes (constraint added later)
* rewrite methods functional style
* focus to replace temp with query
* small functions
* maybe zero warnings first (done)
